Q1:
Ans Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around
       data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes
       and behavior

Q2:
Ans:	1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting
	2. Reuse of code through inheritance
	3. Flexibility through polymorphism
	4. Effective problem solving

Q3:
Ans:	1. Simply, function and method both look similar as they perform in almost similar way, but the key 
	    difference is the concept of ‘Class and its Object‘. 

	2. Functions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently. But methods can’t be called by its
	    name only, we need to invoke the class by a reference of that class in which it is defined, i.e. method is
	    defined within a class and hence they are dependent on that class.

Q4:	
Ans:	Class:
	A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other
	 words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object
	
	Object:
	An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make
	 a particular type of data useful. Object determines the behavior of the class. When you send a message to
	 an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods

	Attributes:
	Attributes are the characteristics of the class that help to distinguish it from other classes

	Behaviour:
	Behaviors are the tasks that an object performs.
